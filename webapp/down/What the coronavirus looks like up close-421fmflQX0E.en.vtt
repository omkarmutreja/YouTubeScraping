00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.800
This is it.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.340
This is SARS-CoV-2.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.730
The novel coronavirus that first appeared
in humans in late 2019.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.520
These are some of the first close-up views
of the virus, made using a very specific imaging

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.680
technique.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.680
That can see things far too small to be visible
under a normal microscope.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.660
They show us how the virus moves inside the
human body,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.280
And how it hijacks our cells, using these.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.210
These spikey crowns give the coronavirus its
name.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.780
And they’re the key to understanding how
to beat it.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.040
To get this right, I need to bring in two
experts.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.760
The first is my colleague Liz’s dad, Frank.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.250
He teaches materials science and engineering
at Ohio State University.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.399
Yes! So that’s how you pronounce it. Okay
that’s a good start.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.040
And the other is Beth Fischer.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.719
Her team at NIAID, the National Institute
of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, created

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.122
those initial images of the virus.

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:06.580
The ones you’ll start to notice embedded
in news articles around the internet.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.920
So let’s start with how these images were
made.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.660
The first thing you need to know is that the
coronavirus it’s very, very, very, small.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.660
Around 100 nanometers.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.640
To put that into context, if you take out
a ruler and look at one of the millimeter

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.909
markings, you could fit 10,000 virus particles
inside of that.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.479
At that size, it’s invisible to us, even
under a standard light microscope, like the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.189
one you might have used in grade school.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.160
That’s because the smallest wavelengths
of light humans can see measure about 400

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.160
nm.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.450
Not small enough for the coronavirus to be
visible.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.189
In order to see something that small, you
need an electron microscope.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.400
How does it actually differ from what we would
think of as a microscope?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.110
Instead of light we’re using electrons.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.590
And electrons you think of as particles.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.590
But if you take the electron, strip it off
of the atom, and accelerate it in a field

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.000
and make it fly really fast.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.060
And that wavelength is much, much smaller
than the light waves we use in a standard

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.069
microscope.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.799
So now you’re like 6, 7, 8 magnitudes smaller
in size.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.269
So now you can see smaller stuff.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.400
If you look through NIAID’s coronavirus
Flickr page, you’ll come across two distinct

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.629
types of images.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.159
SEM and TEM.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.090
They’re made using two different types of
electron microscopes.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.819
A Scanning Electron Microscope, or SEM, scans
the surface of a sample and records what bounces

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.269
back, sort of like how satellite imaging works.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.139
It gives you the basic topography of whatever
you’re looking at, with realistic lighting

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.120
similar to photography.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.609
Shadow and relative size of objects shows
you their placement and how they move through

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.409
the cell.
A Transmission Electron Microscope, or TEM,

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.459
goes way deeper.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.090
It records the inner details of a sample by
transmitting electrons through it.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.489
And projecting a cross section of its inner
structure.

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.090
So it’s part of the basic science research
to try and understand structurally what’s

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.090
going on

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.889
Images from both microscopes are taken in
black and white, the color is added later

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.010
for clarity.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.010
Like in this SEM image, where virus particles,
colored in yellow, are seen emerging from

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.700
the surface of a cell, colored blue and pink.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.970
When examined together, these images can help
scientists start to figure out how coronavirus

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.970
works.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.590
There’s ways to start then understanding
how is it getting in a cell?

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.040
How is it harnessing that cell machinery to
make more of itself?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.120
Can you just tell me kind of what we’re
looking at here?

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.069
So this is a single viral particle.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.000
And the yellow you see is the core of the
virus itself.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.760
And then the corona, where coronaviruses get
their name, is that halo around it that’s

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760
in orange.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.930
That corona is the key to understanding how
the virus hijacks our cells.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.329
The spike proteins that surround the virus
attach to a host cell’s membrane and then

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.450
penetrate it.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.779
Once it forces its way in, it spreads its
RNA around the host cell, multiplies, exits,

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.299
and repeats, which makes us sick.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.829
So if we can bind those spike proteins up
with something like an antibody, it’ll prevent

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.279
them from being able to attach and enter cells.

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.829
Which is exactly how we’ve beaten back viruses
with similar spiky proteins before.

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.709
This is a 3D rendering of the ebola virus.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.519
You see all those proteins on the surface
– when we talk about the spike proteins,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.810
that’s what we’re talking about, no matter
which virus we’re looking at.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.580
This is HIV actually.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.180
So this is printed after we do our cryo-TEM.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.400
And you can see all these tiny little proteins
and how they’re distributed on the surface.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.140
And these are the proteins that we tend to
target for vaccine development.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.979
Is there anything, about the images specifically,
that you’d want to share with our audience

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.639
that maybe you think would be helpful for
them to know?

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.759
I think when you can face your enemy, it takes
a little bit of the fear factor out of it.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.289
I think it’s just understanding what it
is we’re looking at and how it works within

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.289
our bodies.

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.280
But to show that

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.440
I think is important to know.
